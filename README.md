# Simple Bulk Episodes

## Introduction

A simple way to add a bulk of episodes for the Seriously Simple Podcasting plugin.

Adding multiple podcast episodes at a time can be time consuming and cumbersome. This plugin aims to speed up the process! It's as simple as entering all your relevant podcast episode information to a spreadsheet, copying the info and pasting it into the plugin's Bulk Episodes page in the WordPress Admin.

This plugin is designed to work with the excellent podcasting plugin, Seriously Simple Podcasting.
