# Simple Bulk Episodes

## Introduction

A simple way to add a bulk of episodes for the Seriously Simple Podcasting plugin.

Adding multiple podcast episodes at a time can be time consuming and cumbersome. This plugin aims to speed up the process! It's as simple as entering all your relevant podcast episode information to a spreadsheet, copying the info and pasting it into the plugin's Bulk Episodes page in the WordPress Admin.

This plugin is designed to work with Hugh Lashbrooke's excellent podcasting plugin, Seriously Simple Podcasting.
